# internal-monaco-editor-pane Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-internal-monaco-editor-pane. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Pane SHALL open at a per-session route

The dashboard SHALL expose a route `/session/:id/editor?file=<relPath>&line=<n>` that
renders the internal editor pane for the named session. The pane SHALL be mountable
**inside the chat + editor split** (co-existing with `ChatView`), not only as a
full-screen replacement of `ChatView`. Entering the route SHALL open the split (via the
`openInSplit` helper) and render the pane alongside `ChatView`. The route SHALL be
parseable from inbound URLs (browser back/forward, copied URLs) and SHALL restore the
pane state from `localStorage` on mount.

When the route is entered with a `file` query parameter, the named file SHALL be opened
in a new (or existing if already open) tab and that tab SHALL become active. When `line`
is provided, the active viewer SHALL scroll to that line (1-indexed).

A close/unsplit affordance SHALL exist in the pane header. Activating it SHALL close the
split (returning the content area to `ChatView`) without destroying the persisted pane
state.

#### Scenario: Route opens the pane inside the split
- **GIVEN** a session `abc123` whose cwd is `/Users/u/proj`
- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/session/abc123/editor?file=src/foo.ts&line=42`
- **THEN** the split opens and the editor pane renders alongside `ChatView`
- **AND** `src/foo.ts` is open in an active tab, scrolled so line 42 is visible

#### Scenario: Close affordance unsplits without destroying pane state
- **GIVEN** the pane is open in the split with three tabs
- **WHEN** the user activates the close/unsplit affordance in the pane header
- **THEN** the content area renders `ChatView` alone
- **AND** the three tabs remain in `localStorage`
- **AND** re-opening the split restores the three tabs and the previously active one

### Requirement: Pane SHALL host multi-file tabs

The pane SHALL display a horizontal tab list of open files. Exactly one tab SHALL be active at any time. Opening a file that is already open SHALL activate its existing tab rather than creating a duplicate.

The tab list SHALL support:

- click to activate,
- middle-click or "×" to close,
- `Ctrl/Cmd-W` keyboard shortcut to close the active tab,
- drag to reorder.

Closing the last tab SHALL leave the pane in an empty state with a "no files open — pick one from the tree" message. The pane SHALL NOT navigate back to chat on last-tab-close.

#### Scenario: Opening an already-open file activates its tab
- **GIVEN** the pane has `a.ts` (index 0, active) and `b.ts` (index 1) open
- **WHEN** the user triggers `openFile("a.ts")` from the file tree
- **THEN** the tab list still has exactly two tabs
- **AND** `a.ts` (index 0) is the active tab
- **AND** no duplicate is created

#### Scenario: Closing the active tab activates the next adjacent tab
- **GIVEN** tabs `a.ts`, `b.ts`, `c.ts` with `b.ts` active
- **WHEN** the user closes `b.ts`
- **THEN** `c.ts` becomes active
- **AND** the tab list contains `a.ts`, `c.ts`

#### Scenario: Closing the last tab leaves the pane in empty state
- **GIVEN** a single tab `a.ts` is open and active
- **WHEN** the user closes `a.ts`
- **THEN** the pane displays an empty-state message
- **AND** the pane remains on the `/session/:id/editor` route
- **AND** the tree rail remains visible

### Requirement: Pane SHALL host a collapsible file-tree rail

The pane SHALL render a file-tree browse rail on the left, rooted at the session's
`cwd`, collapsible via a **labelled, discoverable toggle at the rail↔viewer boundary**
(not a bare unlabelled icon buried among header actions). Rail visibility SHALL persist
per session. In the **absence of a persisted preference** for a session, the rail SHALL
default to **collapsed** so the opened viewer fills the pane width; a user's explicit
toggle SHALL persist per session and override the collapsed default on subsequent opens
(the rail SHALL NOT re-collapse each time the split reopens once the user has revealed
it for that session).

The rail SHALL list a directory's entries from a **single tree-listing source of truth**
returning `{ name: string; isDir: boolean }` per entry, so **hidden directories
(`.`-prefixed, e.g. `.git`, `.pi`) render and expand as folders** — never as files. The
rail SHALL NOT infer directory-ness by intersecting a full name list with a
hidden-stripped directory list.

Each row SHALL show a **per-kind mime icon** derived from the shared `fileKind`
classifier (distinct icon/colour for code, json, markdown, pdf, image, video, audio,
mermaid, folder, hidden-folder). Clicking a file SHALL invoke the file-open path with
the classifier's viewer kind; clicking a directory SHALL expand/collapse it.

#### Scenario: Hidden directory renders and expands as a folder
- **GIVEN** a session cwd containing `.git/` and `.pi/`
- **WHEN** the rail lists the cwd
- **THEN** `.git` and `.pi` render as folders with an expand chevron
- **AND** clicking one expands to show its child entries
- **AND** neither is treated as a file / passed to `openFile`

#### Scenario: Rows show per-kind icons
- **WHEN** the rail lists `index.ts`, `config.json`, `logo.png`, `demo.mp4`, `chime.mp3`, `arch.mmd`, `spec.pdf`
- **THEN** each row shows a distinct mime icon derived from `fileKind`

#### Scenario: Rail toggle is labelled and persistent
- **WHEN** the user collapses the rail via the labelled toggle
- **THEN** the rail hides and the viewer fills the freed width
- **AND** the collapsed state persists across reload

#### Scenario: Rail defaults to collapsed with no persisted preference
- **GIVEN** a session with no persisted rail-visibility preference
- **WHEN** the split content viewer opens (e.g. via `openInSplit`)
- **THEN** the Files rail SHALL be collapsed and the viewer SHALL fill the pane width
- **AND** the labelled `[Files]` toggle SHALL remain present so the rail can be revealed

#### Scenario: Revealed rail stays revealed for the session
- **GIVEN** a session whose split viewer opened with the rail collapsed by default
- **WHEN** the user reveals the rail via the `[Files]` toggle
- **THEN** the revealed state SHALL persist for that session across reload
- **AND** reopening the split for that session SHALL NOT re-collapse the rail

### Requirement: Pane SHALL dispatch viewers via a kind-based registry

The pane SHALL dispatch the active tab to a viewer via a kind-based registry. The
registry SHALL cover: `monaco` (text/code), `markdown`, `image`, `pdf`, `html`,
`video`, `audio`, `mermaid`, and `binary-warn`. Where a shared `preview/*` renderer
exists for a kind, the registry entry SHALL delegate to it rather than a pane-local
duplicate:

- `pdf` → `PdfPreview` (pdfjs canvas render), NOT `<object type="application/pdf">`,
  so PDFs render in the Electron shell without a native PDF plugin.
- `html` → `HtmlPreview` (`<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" srcDoc={text}>`, scripts
  disabled), NOT `<iframe src="/api/file/raw">` (which would execute in the dashboard
  origin).
- `image` → `ImagePreview`, `video` → `VideoPreview`, `audio` → `AudioPreview`,
  `mermaid` → `MermaidBlock`.

`fileKind` SHALL classify `.html`/`.htm` → html, `.mmd`/`.mermaid` → mermaid,
`.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg`/`.m4a`/`.flac` → audio, and `.webm`/`.mov` → video. The `line`
scroll target SHALL be passed only to the `monaco` viewer.

#### Scenario: PDF renders via pdfjs, not a native plugin
- **GIVEN** the pane runs inside the Electron shell (no PDF plugin)
- **WHEN** the user opens a `.pdf` tab
- **THEN** the tab renders `PdfPreview` (canvas) with page navigation
- **AND** no download-only fallback is shown

#### Scenario: HTML file renders sandboxed with scripts disabled
- **WHEN** the user opens a local `.html` tab
- **THEN** the tab renders `HtmlPreview` via `<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" srcDoc>`
- **AND** the iframe has no `allow-scripts` (embedded JS does not execute)
- **AND** the HTML is not loaded via `<iframe src="/api/file/raw">`

#### Scenario: Media and mermaid kinds dispatch to shared renderers
- **WHEN** the user opens `.mp4`, `.mp3`, or `.mmd` tabs
- **THEN** they render `VideoPreview`, `AudioPreview`, and `MermaidBlock` respectively

### Requirement: Pane SHALL be read-only in v1

The Monaco editor SHALL be configured with `readOnly: true`. The pane SHALL display no save button, no dirty indicator, and no "+" affordance for creating new files in v1.

The shared `fileKind` classifier SHALL return `editable: false` for every file EXCEPT the writable markdown subset (`.md`/`.mdx`), which returns `editable: true`. Only the markdown viewer's Edit mode (see "Markdown tabs SHALL offer a Preview/Edit toggle") exposes a save path; all other viewers (Monaco text/code, media, pdf, html) remain read-only.

When the agent edits a file that the user has open, the pane SHALL NOT auto-refresh. A manual refresh button in the pane header SHALL re-fetch the active file's content from `/api/file`. (Auto-refresh on agent edits is deferred to v4.)

#### Scenario: Read-only editor rejects keystrokes
- **GIVEN** the pane has `foo.ts` open in a Monaco tab
- **WHEN** the user types into the editor area
- **THEN** the buffer content is unchanged
- **AND** no `POST /api/file/write` request is issued

#### Scenario: Manual refresh re-fetches active file
- **GIVEN** `foo.ts` is open in the pane
- **AND** the agent has just written new content to `foo.ts` via the Edit tool
- **WHEN** the user clicks the refresh button in the pane header
- **THEN** the pane issues `GET /api/file?cwd=<cwd>&path=foo.ts`
- **AND** the Monaco buffer updates to the new content
- **AND** the refresh is performed without closing or reopening the tab

### Requirement: Pane state SHALL persist per session in localStorage

Open tabs, active tab index, and expanded tree directories SHALL persist in `localStorage` under key `pi-dashboard:editor-pane:<sessionId>`. State SHALL be restored on page reload, on dashboard restart, and on re-entry to the route within the same browser profile.

State persistence SHALL be best-effort: quota errors and corrupt JSON SHALL NOT crash the pane; failures SHALL be logged and the in-memory state SHALL continue to function.

State SHALL be scoped per session id — switching sessions SHALL load that session's distinct pane state.

#### Scenario: Reload restores open tabs
- **GIVEN** the pane has `a.ts` and `b.ts` open with `b.ts` active
- **WHEN** the user reloads the browser page
- **AND** re-navigates to `/session/:id/editor`
- **THEN** the tab list shows `a.ts` and `b.ts`
- **AND** `b.ts` is the active tab

#### Scenario: Dashboard restart preserves pane state
- **GIVEN** the pane has three tabs open
- **WHEN** the dashboard server restarts via `POST /api/restart`
- **AND** the client reconnects
- **THEN** the three tabs are still rendered without re-opening
- **AND** the active tab is unchanged

#### Scenario: Corrupt localStorage value does not crash the pane
- **GIVEN** `localStorage.getItem("pi-dashboard:editor-pane:abc123")` returns malformed JSON
- **WHEN** the user opens the pane for session `abc123`
- **THEN** the pane renders with an empty state (no tabs)
- **AND** an error is logged to the console
- **AND** the pane functions normally on subsequent state changes

### Requirement: Monaco bundle SHALL be lazy-loaded with a curated language allowlist

The Monaco editor and its language workers SHALL be packaged as a Vite-split lazy chunk loaded only on first text-file open. Sessions whose pane never opens a Monaco-rendered file SHALL NOT trigger the Monaco chunk to load.

The bundled language set SHALL be curated to: TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, Python, Go, Rust, YAML, HTML, CSS, SQL, Shell (a baseline allowlist). Other languages SHALL fall back to plain-text rendering in Monaco without their dedicated worker.

The lazy chunk gzipped size SHALL be ≤ 2 MB (warn budget) and SHALL be ≤ 3 MB (hard fail in CI).

#### Scenario: Pane open without text files does not load Monaco
- **GIVEN** a session whose pane only opens an image file
- **WHEN** the pane renders the image tab
- **THEN** no network request for the Monaco chunk is issued
- **AND** the `MonacoBuffer` lazy boundary remains unresolved

#### Scenario: First text-file open triggers Monaco chunk fetch
- **GIVEN** the pane is open with no text tabs
- **WHEN** the user opens `src/foo.ts`
- **THEN** the dashboard fetches the Monaco chunk
- **AND** displays a loading skeleton until the chunk resolves
- **AND** then renders the Monaco editor

### Requirement: Server SHALL extend `/api/file` and add `/api/file/raw`

`GET /api/file?cwd=<cwd>&path=<relPath>` SHALL return `{ type: "file", kind, mimeType, size, content? }` for file entries. `content` SHALL be present for `kind ∈ { "text", "markdown" }` and SHALL be omitted for `image`, `pdf`, `binary`.

`GET /api/file/raw?cwd=<cwd>&path=<relPath>` SHALL stream raw file bytes with the resolved `Content-Type` header. Both endpoints SHALL apply the existing security gates: `cwd` matched against a known session path; resolved path SHALL start with `cwd + path.sep` (path-traversal prevention).

The file-kind discrimination SHALL invoke the shared `fileKind` module with the first 1024 bytes of the file as the `sniff` argument; the server SHALL NOT read the full file just to classify.

#### Scenario: Text file returns content + kind
- **WHEN** `GET /api/file?cwd=/Users/u/proj&path=src/foo.ts` succeeds
- **THEN** the response is `{ success: true, data: { type: "file", kind: "text", mimeType: "text/x.typescript", size: 1234, content: "..." } }`

#### Scenario: Image file omits content
- **WHEN** `GET /api/file?cwd=/Users/u/proj&path=logo.png` succeeds
- **THEN** the response is `{ success: true, data: { type: "file", kind: "image", mimeType: "image/png", size: 5678 } }`
- **AND** the response body does NOT include `content`

#### Scenario: Raw endpoint streams bytes with correct Content-Type
- **WHEN** the client issues `GET /api/file/raw?cwd=/Users/u/proj&path=logo.png`
- **THEN** the server streams the raw PNG bytes
- **AND** the response includes `Content-Type: image/png`

#### Scenario: Path traversal rejected on raw endpoint
- **WHEN** the client issues `GET /api/file/raw?cwd=/Users/u/proj&path=../../../etc/passwd`
- **THEN** the server responds 403 with `{ success: false, error: "path outside working directory" }`
- **AND** no file content is transmitted

### Requirement: Shared `fileKind` classifier SHALL be the single source of viewer discrimination

The pure module `packages/shared/src/file-kind.ts` SHALL export `fileKind(absPath: string, sniff?: Buffer | string): { kind, mimeType, viewer, editable }`. Both server (`/api/file`, `/api/file/raw`) and client (`OpenFileButton`, `EditorFileTree`) SHALL use this function — no separate discrimination logic SHALL exist elsewhere.

The function SHALL be pure: same inputs always produce the same output; no I/O. Sniff is optional; when absent the function SHALL classify by extension only.

In v1 the `editable` field SHALL always return `false`. v3/v4 will repurpose this field; v1 callers SHALL ignore it for the present.

#### Scenario: Same extension classifies identically on both ends
- **GIVEN** the path `/abs/cwd/src/foo.ts`
- **WHEN** both server and client invoke `fileKind` with that path
- **THEN** both return `{ kind: "text", viewer: "monaco", editable: false }`
- **AND** the `mimeType` strings match

#### Scenario: Sniff promotes unknown extension to binary
- **GIVEN** an extension-less file `bin/myhelper` whose first 1024 bytes contain a NUL byte
- **WHEN** the server invokes `fileKind("/abs/cwd/bin/myhelper", sniff)`
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: "binary", viewer: "binary-warn", editable: false }`
- **AND** without `sniff` the same path classifies as `{ kind: "unknown", viewer: "monaco" }`

### Requirement: Pane SHALL surface a changed-on-disk banner for open files

The server SHALL watch the files currently open in a session's editor pane and emit a
`file_changed` signal when an open file changes on disk (e.g. an agent edit or an
external change). On receiving the signal for an open tab, the pane SHALL display a
per-tab banner stating the file changed on disk and offering a **Refresh** action. The
pane SHALL NOT auto-reload the buffer (preserving the read-only-v1 no-auto-refresh
decision); Refresh SHALL re-fetch via the existing manual-refresh path. Dismissing the
banner SHALL leave the cached (stale) view in place.

The watch SHALL be scoped to the pane's **open files only** — not the whole `cwd` tree
— and SHALL be created and torn down as tabs open and close, on session switch, and on
client disconnect, so no file descriptors leak.

#### Scenario: Agent edit to an open file shows the banner
- **GIVEN** `foo.ts` is open in the pane and unchanged on disk
- **WHEN** the agent writes new content to `foo.ts`
- **THEN** the pane displays a changed-on-disk banner on the `foo.ts` tab
- **AND** the buffer content is NOT auto-reloaded

#### Scenario: Refresh re-fetches the changed file
- **GIVEN** the changed-on-disk banner is shown for `foo.ts`
- **WHEN** the user activates Refresh
- **THEN** the pane re-fetches `GET /api/file?cwd=<cwd>&path=foo.ts`
- **AND** the Monaco buffer updates to the new content
- **AND** the banner clears

#### Scenario: Closing a tab tears down its watch
- **GIVEN** `foo.ts` and `bar.ts` are open with active watches
- **WHEN** the user closes the `foo.ts` tab
- **THEN** the watch on `foo.ts` is torn down
- **AND** the watch on `bar.ts` remains active

#### Scenario: Change to a non-open file does not signal
- **GIVEN** only `foo.ts` is open in the pane
- **WHEN** an unrelated file `baz.ts` (not open) changes on disk
- **THEN** no changed-on-disk banner is shown

### Requirement: Pane viewers SHALL follow the dashboard theme live

Pane viewers with their own colour theme SHALL consume the shared theme via
`useThemeContext()` (the `ThemeProvider` value), NOT the raw per-instance `useTheme()`
hook — this applies to the `monaco` text/code viewer and the markdown editor. When the
dashboard named theme or light/dark mode changes, open editor viewers SHALL recolour
without remount.

#### Scenario: Monaco recolours on theme switch
- **GIVEN** a `.ts` file open in a Monaco tab in dark mode
- **WHEN** the dashboard is switched to light mode
- **THEN** the Monaco editor recolours to the light theme without reopening the tab

### Requirement: Tree and tabs SHALL stay in sync both directions

Opening a file (from tree click, chat file-link, or search result) SHALL auto-expand
every ancestor directory of the file in the rail and reveal + highlight its row.
Changing the active tab SHALL likewise reveal + highlight the corresponding tree row.
The highlight SHALL track the active tab's path.

#### Scenario: Opening a deep file reveals it in the tree
- **GIVEN** the rail is collapsed at the root
- **WHEN** the user opens `src/components/EditorPane.tsx` via a chat file-link
- **THEN** `src/` and `src/components/` expand
- **AND** the `EditorPane.tsx` row is highlighted and scrolled into view

#### Scenario: Switching tabs syncs the tree highlight
- **GIVEN** three tabs open from different directories
- **WHEN** the user activates a different tab
- **THEN** the tree highlight moves to that file's row and scrolls it into view

### Requirement: Markdown tabs SHALL offer a Preview/Edit toggle

The markdown tab SHALL offer a per-tab **Preview / Edit** toggle for files whose
`fileKind` reports `editable` (`.md`/`.mdx`). Edit mode SHALL mount the controlled
`MarkdownEditor`. Saving SHALL `POST /api/file/write` with the buffer's loaded `mtime`;
a `409` (changed on disk) SHALL surface the existing changed-on-disk banner and leave
the file untouched. Non-editable markdown (`.markdown`) SHALL remain preview-only.

#### Scenario: Edit and save a markdown file
- **GIVEN** a `.md` file open in Preview mode
- **WHEN** the user switches to Edit, changes text, and clicks Save
- **THEN** the client POSTs `/api/file/write` with the loaded `mtime`
- **AND** on success the dirty indicator clears

#### Scenario: Non-editable markdown has no Edit affordance
- **WHEN** the user opens a `.markdown` file
- **THEN** only Preview is available (no Edit toggle)

#### Scenario: Stale write is rejected
- **GIVEN** a `.md` file edited in the pane while the agent rewrote it on disk
- **WHEN** the user clicks Save
- **THEN** the write returns 409 and the changed-on-disk banner appears
- **AND** the on-disk file is unchanged
