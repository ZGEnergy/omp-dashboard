# chat-transcript-virtualization

## Purpose

Bound the chat transcript's per-frame layout and paint work to the viewport working set plus the streaming tail, so cost does not grow with total session length, while preserving all existing scroll and streaming semantics.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Off-screen transcript content costs no layout or paint

The chat transcript SHALL limit per-frame layout and paint work to messages near the viewport plus the streaming tail. Messages far outside the viewport MUST NOT contribute to style-recalculation, layout, or paint cost (first step: `content-visibility: auto` with a tuned `contain-intrinsic-size` on per-message wrappers; full windowing only if the budget is still missed).

#### Scenario: Layout cost bounded regardless of session length
- **WHEN** a session transcript grows arbitrarily long (hundreds of messages, tens of thousands of DOM nodes)
- **THEN** the number of layout objects processed per layout pass SHALL remain bounded by the viewport working set (not the full transcript), and per-pass layout duration SHALL NOT grow with total session length

#### Scenario: Off-screen strips are not repainted
- **WHEN** animations or state changes trigger paints while a long transcript is open
- **THEN** paint records SHALL NOT include repeated rasterization of tall off-screen transcript regions

### Requirement: Virtualization preserves scroll and streaming semantics

Skipping off-screen rendering SHALL NOT change user-visible scrolling behavior: bottom-anchored auto-scroll while following, scroll-lock when the user has scrolled up (per the existing `chat-scroll-lock` capability), jump-to-message, and the imperative `ChatViewHandle` API MUST behave exactly as before.

#### Scenario: Auto-scroll follow unaffected
- **WHEN** the user is at/near the bottom and new content streams in
- **THEN** the view SHALL auto-scroll to follow, with no visible jumps caused by off-screen size estimation

#### Scenario: Scrolling back through history
- **WHEN** the user scrolls up through older messages
- **THEN** messages SHALL appear rendered and correctly sized as they enter the viewport, without scroll-position jumps or blank flashes lasting beyond one frame

#### Scenario: Streaming tail always rendered
- **WHEN** a message is currently streaming (`streamingText`/`streamingThinking`)
- **THEN** the streaming content SHALL always be fully rendered and never skipped by the off-screen optimization
