# dashboard-starter-identity

## Purpose

Defines a runtime identity (`DASHBOARD_STARTER`) that every dashboard server process inherits from its spawner, so downstream consumers (update checker, lifecycle owner, reinstall endpoint) can derive behaviour from "who started the server" without consulting persisted mode flags.

## Requirements

### Requirement: DASHBOARD_STARTER env var contract

Every spawn site that produces a dashboard server process SHALL set `DASHBOARD_STARTER` on the spawned process env to one of `"Bridge"`, `"Standalone"`, or `"Electron"`. The server SHALL read this variable once at boot, validate against the enum, default to `"Standalone"` when unset, and persist the value in `bootstrap-state` for the lifetime of the process.

#### Scenario: Bridge auto-start sets starter

- **WHEN** `packages/extension/src/server-launcher.ts:launchServer` spawns the dashboard server
- **THEN** the spawn options env SHALL include `DASHBOARD_STARTER: "Bridge"`

#### Scenario: Electron launch sets starter

- **WHEN** `packages/electron/src/lib/launch-source.ts:spawnFromSource` spawns the dashboard server for any non-`attach` source kind
- **THEN** the spawn options env SHALL include `DASHBOARD_STARTER: "Electron"`

#### Scenario: Direct CLI invocation defaults to Standalone

- **WHEN** the user invokes `pi-dashboard start` from a terminal with no explicit `DASHBOARD_STARTER` env set
- **THEN** the server SHALL default the starter value to `"Standalone"`

#### Scenario: Invalid starter value rejected

- **WHEN** the server boots AND `DASHBOARD_STARTER` is set to a value outside the enum
- **THEN** the server SHALL log a warning AND default the starter to `"Standalone"`

### Requirement: Starter exposed via /api/health

The HTTP health endpoint SHALL expose the running server's starter value alongside the existing health fields, enabling clients to determine lifecycle ownership without reading process env.

#### Scenario: /api/health includes starter

- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/health`
- **THEN** the response body SHALL include `starter` field set to the server's `DashboardStarter` value
- **AND** the response SHALL include the existing `version`, `mode`, and `pid` fields

### Requirement: Lifecycle ownership rule

The Electron app SHALL stop the dashboard server on quit if and only if the running server's starter is `"Electron"` AND the running server's pid matches the pid Electron spawned during this Electron process lifetime.

#### Scenario: Electron quit stops own server

- **WHEN** Electron quits AND the running server's `health.starter === "Electron"` AND `health.pid === storedSpawnedPid`
- **THEN** Electron SHALL send the server a graceful shutdown signal
- **AND** SHALL await server exit before terminating its own process

#### Scenario: Electron quit leaves Bridge-started server

- **WHEN** Electron quits AND the running server's `health.starter === "Bridge"`
- **THEN** Electron SHALL NOT send any shutdown signal to the server
- **AND** SHALL terminate its own process leaving the server running

#### Scenario: Electron quit leaves Standalone-started server

- **WHEN** Electron quits AND the running server's `health.starter === "Standalone"`
- **THEN** Electron SHALL NOT send any shutdown signal to the server
- **AND** SHALL terminate its own process leaving the server running

#### Scenario: Electron quit leaves other-Electron-started server

- **WHEN** Electron quits AND the running server's `health.starter === "Electron"` AND `health.pid !== storedSpawnedPid`
- **THEN** Electron SHALL NOT send any shutdown signal to the server
- **AND** SHALL terminate its own process leaving the server running

### Requirement: Update strategy derived from starter

The Electron update checker SHALL select its update strategy from `health.starter` rather than from any persisted mode flag. The mapping SHALL be `Electron → in-app updater`, `Standalone → npm update -g recommendation`, `Bridge → defer to pi version bump`.

#### Scenario: Electron starter uses in-app updater

- **WHEN** the update checker runs AND `health.starter === "Electron"`
- **THEN** the checker SHALL invoke the existing in-app updater path

#### Scenario: Standalone starter recommends npm update

- **WHEN** the update checker runs AND `health.starter === "Standalone"`
- **THEN** the checker SHALL surface a notification recommending `npm update -g @blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard`
- **AND** SHALL NOT invoke the in-app updater

#### Scenario: Bridge starter defers to pi

- **WHEN** the update checker runs AND `health.starter === "Bridge"`
- **THEN** the checker SHALL surface a notification stating the dashboard is bundled with pi
- **AND** SHALL NOT invoke any update mechanism
