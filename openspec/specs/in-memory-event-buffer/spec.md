## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: In-memory event storage
The dashboard server SHALL store events in an in-memory `Map<sessionId, { events: StoredEvent[], lastAccess: number }>` instead of SQLite. The EventStore interface (`insertEvent`, `getEvents`, `getEvent`, `deleteEventsForSession`, `hasEvents`, `sessionCount`) SHALL be preserved so consumers (browser-gateway, server) remain unchanged. The EventStore SHALL additionally expose `getMaxSeq(sessionId): number` to return the highest stored sequence number for a session.

#### Scenario: Event insertion
- **WHEN** an event arrives from a bridge extension for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL assign the next sequence number, store the event in the in-memory buffer for that session, and update `lastAccess` to the current timestamp

#### Scenario: Event retrieval for replay
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 50` for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL return all events with seq > 50 from the in-memory buffer

#### Scenario: Full replay
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with no `lastSeq` for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL return all events from the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Delete events for session
- **WHEN** a bridge reconnects and the server determines a full wipe is needed (eventCount mismatch or no eventCount provided)
- **THEN** the server SHALL clear the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Skip delete when eventCount matches
- **WHEN** a bridge reconnects with matching `eventCount`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT clear the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Fetch single event
- **WHEN** a browser requests a specific event by sessionId and seq
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the event from the in-memory buffer, or undefined if not found

#### Scenario: Get max sequence number
- **WHEN** the subscription handler needs to detect stale `lastSeq`
- **THEN** `getMaxSeq(sessionId)` SHALL return the highest seq in the buffer, or `0` if no events exist

### Requirement: LRU eviction policy
The in-memory event buffer SHALL enforce a maximum number of cached sessions (default 100, configurable). When the limit is exceeded, the least-recently-accessed ended sessions with zero browser subscribers SHALL be evicted.

#### Scenario: Eviction triggers on insert
- **WHEN** an event is inserted and the total cached session count exceeds `MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS`
- **THEN** the server SHALL evict the least-recently-accessed session that is ended and has zero browser subscribers

#### Scenario: Active sessions are never evicted
- **WHEN** eviction runs and a session has an active bridge connection
- **THEN** that session SHALL NOT be evicted regardless of `lastAccess`

#### Scenario: Subscribed sessions are never evicted
- **WHEN** eviction runs and a session has browser subscribers
- **THEN** that session SHALL NOT be evicted regardless of `lastAccess`

#### Scenario: Evicted session re-requested
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to a session whose events were evicted
- **THEN** the server SHALL trigger on-demand loading via bridge (see on-demand-session-replay spec)

#### Scenario: lastAccess updated on read
- **WHEN** events are read for a session (getEvents or getEvent)
- **THEN** the `lastAccess` timestamp SHALL be updated to prevent premature eviction

### Requirement: Image data preservation during truncation
The event store string truncation SHALL preserve base64 image data fields. When truncating object fields, if a key is `"data"` and the parent object contains a `"mimeType"` key, the value SHALL NOT be truncated.

#### Scenario: Image base64 data preserved
- **WHEN** a `message_start` event contains a user message with an image content block `{ type: "image", data: "<200KB base64>", mimeType: "image/png" }`
- **THEN** the event store SHALL store the full `data` string without truncation

#### Scenario: Non-image data fields still truncated
- **WHEN** an event contains an object with `{ data: "<large string>" }` but no `mimeType` key
- **THEN** the `data` field SHALL be truncated per the normal max string size limit

#### Scenario: Other string fields still truncated alongside images
- **WHEN** a `message_start` event contains both an image content block and a large `thinking` field
- **THEN** the `data` field in the image block SHALL be preserved AND the `thinking` field SHALL be truncated normally

### Requirement: Subscriber-count awareness for pinning
The in-memory event store SHALL receive an `isSessionPinned(sessionId): boolean` callback at creation time. The callback SHALL return true when a session has an active bridge connection OR has browser subscribers > 0. Pinned sessions SHALL never be evicted.

#### Scenario: Pinning callback injected at creation
- **WHEN** the memory event store is created
- **THEN** it SHALL accept an `isSessionPinned` callback parameter

#### Scenario: Pinned session skipped during eviction
- **WHEN** eviction runs and `isSessionPinned("abc")` returns true
- **THEN** session "abc" SHALL be skipped and the next evictable session considered
