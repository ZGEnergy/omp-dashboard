## Cherry-pick source

Primary source: `origin/windows-integration-v2` (80 net-new commits vs develop by patch-id).
Secondary source: `origin/windows-integration` HEAD (`bbc11a9`) — contains 2 commits that post-date v2 and are needed: `cce2e57` (tool-registry per-platform) and `304a82b` (terminal X button). The other 3 WI-only commits (`337e5c4` proposal doc duplicate, `8bfe769` compress-lock, `bbc11a9` TS errors post-merge) are v2-local or already on develop and are skipped.

SHAs below are short-form. Run `git show <sha>` on the source remote before picking to confirm.

## Phase -1. Preflight

- [ ] -1.1 `git fetch origin` — ensure `origin/windows-integration`, `origin/windows-integration-v2`, `origin/develop` are current
- [ ] -1.2 Confirm develop HEAD is `2a4445d` (`docs(openspec): add adapt-windows-integration-pr9 proposal`); if develop has moved, update this proposal's base-SHA reference and reconfirm 80/54 net-new counts via `git cherry develop origin/windows-integration-v2` / `git cherry develop origin/windows-integration`
- [ ] -1.3 `git tag -a pre-windows-v3-merge develop -m "rollback anchor before windows-integration-v3"` — local only initially; push after Phase 0 completes
- [ ] -1.4 `git checkout -b windows-integration-v3 develop`

## Phase 0. Safety fixes (bucket #5) — 5 commits

Goal: develop is less broken on fresh Windows install after this phase even if no later phase lands.

- [ ] 0.1 `git cherry-pick 8c2cde5` — chore(server): require Node >=22.18.0 via engines field
- [ ] 0.2 `git cherry-pick 4c564fc` — feat(server): refuse to start on Node versions affected by nodejs/node#58515 (node-guard.ts + 17 tests)
- [ ] 0.3 `git cherry-pick 40a1319` — fix(server): bridge auto-registration path math was off by one
- [ ] 0.4 `git cherry-pick e11f5eb` — fix(extension): resolve server CLI via require.resolve, not sibling path math
- [ ] 0.5 `git cherry-pick 9397320` — fix(server): client-dir resolution works in installed layouts  _(short SHA `9397320` on v2 = `93973206bd5edeafdaf122703a3519363cb2ba8e`)_
- [ ] 0.6 Validation: `npm install && npm test` green (all workspaces)
- [ ] 0.7 Validation: `npm run build` green
- [ ] 0.8 Validation: start dashboard via `npm run dev`, confirm bridge auto-registers on a fresh `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (delete + restart if pre-seeded)
- [ ] 0.9 `git push origin windows-integration-v3 pre-windows-v3-merge`

## Phase 1. platform/ primitives foundation (bucket #1) — 9 commits

Goal: `packages/shared/src/platform/*` exists and is importable; `ToolRegistry` operational.

**Excludes** consolidation commits (`a73178d`, `2aa1d50`, `21d7dc4`, `ab017d8`, `01ac562`) per proposal §Excluded.

- [ ] 1.1 `git cherry-pick 6716a4f` — fix: cross-platform server launch, restart, and stale-port cleanup on Windows _(foundation commit; introduces initial platform helpers)_

- [ ] 1.8 `git cherry-pick c26ec59` — feat(platform): make waitForReady deadlineMs optional (undefined = wait forever)
- [ ] 1.9 `git cherry-pick cce2e57` — fix(tool-registry): register process-inspection tools per-platform (skip ps/pgrep on Windows) _(from origin/windows-integration, not v2)_
- [ ] 1.10 Validation: `npm run build` green
- [ ] 1.11 Validation: `npm test` green across workspaces
- [ ] 1.12 Validation: three lint-style tests green — `no-direct-child-process`, `no-direct-process-kill`, `no-direct-platform-branch`

## Phase 2. Windows fixes on top of #1 (bucket #2) — 6 commits

- [ ] 2.1 `git cherry-pick 1239201` — fix: suppress cmd.exe console flash when spawning .cmd files on Windows
- [ ] 2.2 `git cherry-pick bb05398` — fix: resolve windows binaries via PATHEXT to skip bash shims

- [ ] 2.6 `git cherry-pick 304a82b` — fix(terminal): windows X button — route kill through taskkill /F /T + fallback cleanup _(from origin/windows-integration)_
- [ ] 2.7 Validation: `npm test` green
- [ ] 2.8 Manual Windows smoke: ×3 session spawn, no cmd.exe flash; `/api/restart` works; `pi-dashboard stop` frees ports after TM-kill; terminal X button kills cleanly

## Phase 3. Electron migration (bucket #3) — 3 commits

- [ ] 3.1 `git cherry-pick a97514e` — refactor: migrate electron binary lookup to shared ToolResolver
- [ ] 3.2 `git cherry-pick 455ced4` — refactor: use ToolResolver and isDashboardRunning in Electron doctor/detector (drop where/which and curl)
- [ ] 3.3 `git cherry-pick 8402565` — fix(electron): route server spawn through buildServerSpawnOptions with detach:false
- [ ] 3.4 Validation: `npm run build` green across workspaces including `packages/electron`
- [ ] 3.5 Manual Electron smoke: launch packaged dev build (`npm run start` in `packages/electron`), verify Doctor menu detects pi/openspec/Node, wizard first-run flow works, tray icon renders platform-correct

## Phase 4. Bridge extension (bucket #4) — 6 commits

- [ ] 4.7 Validation: `npm test` green
- [ ] 4.8 Manual bridge smoke: start pi, bridge auto-starts dashboard; spinner renders; on spawn failure, `spawn_error` appears in browser UI

## Phase 5. Test infra (bucket #6) — 3 commits + re-derivation

**v2's `31f5c68` is explicitly NOT picked** (re-conflict risk per design.md).

- [ ] 5.1 `git cherry-pick ce1576d` — test: fix cross-platform assumptions in test fixtures (Windows parity)
- [ ] 5.2 `git cherry-pick b4f712a` — test: add process.kill-ban lint and platform-routing kill-path tests
- [ ] 5.3 Run `npm test` across all workspaces; capture failure list

- [ ] 5.5 Commit test fixes as single `fix(tests): restore green baseline after platform/ + electron + bridge integration`
- [ ] 5.6 Validation: 2519/2519 (or current baseline) green across all workspaces

## Phase 6. Drift features (bucket #8) — 6 commits, each separate

Per user direction: keep as separate commits on the same branch; do not bundle or spin out to separate branches.

- [ ] 6.1 `git cherry-pick 1ee114c` — harden ask_user argument validation
- [ ] 6.2 `git cherry-pick 9446e43` — feat: add pi core version checker and update UI
- [ ] 6.3 `git cherry-pick 6b39c3c` — fix(pi-core): broadcast pi_core_update_complete so the header badge refetches

- [ ] 6.5 `git cherry-pick b80121f` — fix(tunnel): eliminate zrok reservation leaks + shrink client bundle + compress responses _(triple-feature commit; kept as-is per design.md)_
- [ ] 6.6 `git cherry-pick 850abe9` — fix(lint): add ban:child_process-ok markers to pi-core-{checker,updater}.ts
- [ ] 6.7 Validation: `npm test` green, `npm run build` green, smoke each feature individually:
  - pi-core: open Settings → Packages → Pi Core Versions, confirm versions render + Check Now works
  - path-picker: open "Pin a folder", type, confirm server-side filtering
  - zrok: start tunnel, confirm no reservation leak on restart

## Phase 7. OpenSpec docs + archives (bucket #7) — ~8 commits

Pick in one batch at the end; validate `openspec list` + `openspec validate` after each.

- [ ] 7.1 `git cherry-pick 170434e` — docs: document cross-platform server launch, restart, and log hygiene
- [ ] 7.2 `git cherry-pick cf84058` — docs: archive fix-windows-server-parity change and sync main specs
- [ ] 7.3 `git cherry-pick d0adac2` — docs: add consolidate-platform-handlers openspec proposal (active proposal for the deferred 18→13 consolidation)
- [ ] 7.4 `git cherry-pick 2257b08` — docs: refine fix-fork-entryid-timing proposal (see design.md open question #1; if content already archived on develop, fold refinements into archived artifact or skip)
- [ ] 7.5 `git cherry-pick a4f9860` — docs: document platform-routed kill paths in AGENTS and architecture
- [ ] 7.6 `git cherry-pick 0be288f` — docs: archive route-kill-paths-through-platform change and sync main specs
- [ ] 7.7 `git cherry-pick de695e1` — docs(readme): bump required Node to 22.18.0 (nodejs/node#58515)
- [ ] 7.8 `git cherry-pick 821cd63` — chore(openspec): sync and archive 4 completed changes (2026-04-20) _(cherry-pick may become partial/empty if archives already on develop; `--allow-empty` if needed)_
- [ ] 7.9 Add THIS proposal's own artifacts to its superseded-by pointer: update `openspec/changes/adapt-windows-integration-pr9/.openspec.yaml` with `status: superseded` and `superseded-by: merge-windows-integration-linear` (or equivalent field per OpenSpec schema). Commit as `chore(openspec): mark adapt-windows-integration-pr9 superseded`
- [ ] 7.10 Validation: `openspec list` shows no phantom active changes; `openspec validate` green
- [ ] 7.11 Validation: `npm test` green (archive moves can affect spec-coherence tests if any)

## Phase 8. Pre-PR gates

- [ ] 8.1 CI green on Windows, macOS, Linux matrix (full `npm test`)
- [ ] 8.2 CI green on Electron make matrix (DMG / AppImage / NSIS / ZIP)
- [ ] 8.3 Manual Windows smoke per Phase 2.8 + Phase 3.5 + Phase 4.8
- [ ] 8.4 Manual macOS + Linux smoke: landing page, session spawn, terminal, editor, zrok QR
- [ ] 8.5 Three lint-style tests green: `no-direct-child-process`, `no-direct-process-kill`, `no-direct-platform-branch`
- [ ] 8.6 CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` populated with user-visible changes (Windows parity, ToolRegistry, platform/ module, drift features)
- [ ] 8.7 Diff review against `adapt-windows-integration-pr9` durable-requirements spec (specs/cross-platform-merge-baseline/) — confirm all four durable requirements preserved

## Phase 9. PR and release

- [ ] 9.1 Open PR `windows-integration-v3 → develop`; link this proposal, link PR #9 as superseded source
- [ ] 9.2 After merge, run `release-cut` skill to cut `v0.4.0`
- [ ] 9.3 After v0.4.0 ships and smoke-tests green for 24h, open follow-up PR for `platform/` 18→13 consolidation (commits `a73178d`, `2aa1d50`, `21d7dc4`, `ab017d8`, `01ac562` from v2) — tracked by `consolidate-platform-handlers` proposal

## Rollback

Any phase can roll back to `pre-windows-v3-merge` tag:

```bash
git reset --hard pre-windows-v3-merge
git push --force-with-lease origin windows-integration-v3
```

If post-merge on develop regresses, `v0.3.0` remains on npm + GitHub Releases. Deprecate v0.4.0 via `release-revoke` skill; do not unpublish.
