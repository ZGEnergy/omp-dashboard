## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: In-memory event storage
The dashboard server SHALL store events in an in-memory `Map<sessionId, { events: StoredEvent[], lastAccess: number }>` instead of SQLite. The EventStore interface (`insertEvent`, `getEvents`, `getEvent`, `deleteEventsForSession`, `hasEvents`, `sessionCount`) SHALL be preserved so consumers (browser-gateway, server) remain unchanged. The EventStore SHALL additionally expose `getMaxSeq(sessionId): number` to return the highest stored sequence number for a session.

#### Scenario: Event insertion
- **WHEN** an event arrives from a bridge extension for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL assign the next sequence number, store the event in the in-memory buffer for that session, and update `lastAccess` to the current timestamp

#### Scenario: Event retrieval for replay
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 50` for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL return all events with seq > 50 from the in-memory buffer

#### Scenario: Full replay
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with no `lastSeq` for session "abc"
- **THEN** the server SHALL return all events from the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Delete events for session
- **WHEN** a bridge reconnects and the server determines a full wipe is needed (eventCount mismatch or no eventCount provided)
- **THEN** the server SHALL clear the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Skip delete when eventCount matches
- **WHEN** a bridge reconnects with matching `eventCount`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT clear the in-memory buffer for that session

#### Scenario: Fetch single event
- **WHEN** a browser requests a specific event by sessionId and seq
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the event from the in-memory buffer, or undefined if not found

#### Scenario: Get max sequence number
- **WHEN** the subscription handler needs to detect stale `lastSeq`
- **THEN** `getMaxSeq(sessionId)` SHALL return the highest seq in the buffer, or `0` if no events exist
