## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Model metadata enriched via pi's model registry

When the bridge extension's `registerEntry()` function synthesizes a model descriptor for `pi.registerProvider(...)`, it SHALL resolve `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`, `reasoning`, `cost`, and `input` via a pure helper `enrichModelMetadata(discoveredId, api, probe)` that consults pi's `ModelRegistry.find(provider, id)` API through an injected probe. The probe SHALL be built from a module-level `modelRegistryRef` that is captured from `ctx.modelRegistry` in the first `session_start` event handler (and as a fallback, `model_select`) the extension receives. Because `activate()` fires before any event handler, the first registration pass MAY use fallback defaults; the `session_start` handler SHALL trigger an idempotent re-registration pass once `ctx.modelRegistry` is available, overwriting fallback entries with enriched metadata. When no `session_start` handler has yet fired (e.g., in isolated unit tests), the probe SHALL be `null` and the helper SHALL fall through to api-appropriate fallback defaults.

The helper SHALL strip common proxy-prefix path segments before registry lookup so that prefixed ids (e.g., `cc/claude-opus-4-7`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`, `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`) resolve to the same registry entry as the bare id (`claude-opus-4-7`). Specifically, the helper SHALL try the full discovered id first, then the segment after the last `/` if any — in a deduplicated list.

Registry probing SHALL iterate a fixed api-appropriate candidate-provider list in preference order, returning the first match. The helper SHALL tolerate probes that throw by catching the exception and continuing to the next candidate.

The helper SHALL NOT import `@mariozechner/pi-ai` directly; it SHALL consume only the probe function passed as its third argument, which makes it fully unit-testable with a fake probe built from a `Map`.

#### Scenario: Prefixed Anthropic id resolves through anthropic-messages api

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("cc/claude-opus-4-7", "anthropic-messages", probe)` is called
- **AND** `probe("anthropic", "claude-opus-4-7")` returns the catalog entry for Opus 4.7 (1M ctx, 128k maxTok, reasoning, Opus cost)
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `{ contextWindow: 1_000_000, maxTokens: 128_000, reasoning: true, cost: { input: 5, output: 25, cacheRead: 0.5, cacheWrite: 6.25 }, input: ["text","image"] }` (or whatever `input` the registry declared)

#### Scenario: Unprefixed registry-known id resolves

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("claude-sonnet-4-6", "anthropic-messages", probe)` is called
- **AND** `probe("anthropic", "claude-sonnet-4-6")` returns the catalog entry for Sonnet 4.6
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return the registry's full metadata including `contextWindow: 1_000_000`

#### Scenario: Three-segment proxy prefix resolves via last-segment fallback

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("openrouter/openai/gpt-5", "openai-completions", probe)` is called
- **AND** no candidate provider returns a match for the full id `"openrouter/openai/gpt-5"`
- **AND** `probe("openai", "gpt-5")` returns a non-null entry
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return that entry's metadata

#### Scenario: Candidate-provider probe order is deterministic for anthropic-messages

- **WHEN** the helper probes the registry for `anthropic-messages`
- **THEN** it SHALL try providers in the order `["anthropic", "opencode"]`
- **AND** it SHALL return the first match encountered
- **AND** it SHALL NOT consult any other provider once a match is found

#### Scenario: Candidate-provider probe order for google-generative-ai

- **WHEN** the helper probes the registry for `google-generative-ai`
- **THEN** it SHALL try providers in the order `["google", "google-vertex"]`

#### Scenario: Candidate-provider probe order for openai-completions

- **WHEN** the helper probes the registry for `openai-completions`
- **THEN** it SHALL try providers in the order `["openai", "openrouter", "groq", "xai", "mistral"]`

#### Scenario: Probe that throws is tolerated

- **WHEN** the helper's probe throws on one candidate
- **THEN** the helper SHALL catch the exception and continue with the next candidate-provider / id combination
- **AND** if no other combination matches, the helper SHALL return the api-appropriate fallback

#### Scenario: No probe supplied falls back to api-appropriate defaults

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("cc/claude-opus-4-7", "anthropic-messages")` is called without a probe argument (or with `null`)
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `{ contextWindow: 200_000, maxTokens: 64_000, reasoning: false, cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 }, input: ["text","image"] }`

#### Scenario: Registry miss falls back to api-appropriate defaults (anthropic-messages)

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("some-unknown-anthropic-model", "anthropic-messages", probe)` is called
- **AND** no candidate provider × id combination returns a match
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `{ contextWindow: 200_000, maxTokens: 64_000, reasoning: false, cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 }, input: ["text","image"] }`

#### Scenario: Registry miss falls back to api-appropriate defaults (openai-completions)

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("some-unknown-openai-model", "openai-completions", probe)` is called
- **AND** no candidate provider × id combination returns a match
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `{ contextWindow: 128_000, maxTokens: 16_384, reasoning: false, cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 }, input: ["text","image"] }`

#### Scenario: Registry miss falls back to api-appropriate defaults (google-generative-ai)

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("some-unknown-gemini-model", "google-generative-ai", probe)` is called
- **AND** no candidate provider × id combination returns a match
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `{ contextWindow: 1_000_000, maxTokens: 65_536, reasoning: false, cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 }, input: ["text","image"] }`

#### Scenario: Prefixed id with registry miss still falls back correctly

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("minimax/custom-private-model", "openai-completions", probe)` is called
- **AND** neither the full id `minimax/custom-private-model` nor the bare id `custom-private-model` matches any candidate
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return the openai-completions fallback defaults

#### Scenario: Unknown api value is treated as openai-completions

- **WHEN** `enrichModelMetadata("some-id", "unrecognized-api", probe)` is called
- **THEN** the helper SHALL probe the openai-completions candidate list and SHALL use the openai-completions fallback on miss

### Requirement: registerEntry wires modelRegistry into enrichModelMetadata

`registerEntry()` in `packages/extension/src/provider-register.ts` SHALL obtain a probe function by reading a module-level `modelRegistryRef` captured earlier from any pi event handler's `ctx.modelRegistry`. When the registry is available and exposes a `find` method, the probe SHALL be `(provider, id) => registry.find(provider, id) ?? null`. Otherwise the probe SHALL be `null`.

`registerEntry()` SHALL then call `enrichModelMetadata(m.id, entry.api, probe)` for every discovered model id and SHALL spread the returned `{ contextWindow, maxTokens, reasoning, cost, input }` verbatim into the synthesized model descriptor passed to `pi.registerProvider(...)`. The existing behavior of using the bare discovered id as `id` and `name` SHALL be preserved.

The extension's `session_start` handler SHALL capture `ctx.modelRegistry` into `modelRegistryRef` (if not yet set) and SHALL re-register every previously-registered provider so their model metadata is recomputed with the now-available probe. The `model_select` handler SHALL also capture the registry as a fallback, without triggering re-registration.

After the re-registration pass, if the session's currently-selected model (`ctx.model`) belongs to one of the re-registered providers, the `session_start` handler SHALL re-invoke `pi.setModel(refreshed)` with the freshly-enriched descriptor obtained via `ctx.modelRegistry.find(ctx.model.provider, ctx.model.id)`. This re-snapshots pi's `agent.state.model` with the enriched `reasoning` / `contextWindow` / `cost` fields, which is required for `setThinkingLevel` to operate correctly against the new capabilities — pi's `supportsThinking()` reads `state.model.reasoning` directly, and without the re-snapshot the session would keep the fallback `reasoning: false` stamped at pre-enrichment registration time. The re-setModel call SHALL be wrapped in try/catch so a failed refresh does not abort `session_start`.

#### Scenario: Enrichment applied via session_start re-registration pass

- **WHEN** a pi session starts with a `proxy` provider in `providers.json` that advertises `cc/claude-opus-4-7` in its `/v1/models` response
- **AND** `entry.api` is `"anthropic-messages"`
- **AND** pi's model registry has a `find` method that returns Opus 4.7 metadata for `("anthropic", "claude-opus-4-7")`
- **THEN** `activate()` SHALL first register the provider with fallback defaults (no registry yet available)
- **AND** the `session_start` handler SHALL then capture `ctx.modelRegistry` and re-register the provider
- **AND** the second `pi.registerProvider(...)` call SHALL carry a model descriptor with `contextWindow: 1_000_000`, `maxTokens: 128_000`, `reasoning: true`, and the registry's cost object

#### Scenario: Currently-selected model is re-snapshotted after re-registration

- **WHEN** the session's `ctx.model` is `{ provider: "proxy", id: "cc/claude-opus-4-7", reasoning: false, … }` at `session_start` (the fallback-defaults snapshot taken during `activate()`)
- **AND** the re-registration pass updates the `proxy` provider's registry entry with enriched metadata (`reasoning: true`, `contextWindow: 1_000_000`, …)
- **THEN** the `session_start` handler SHALL call `ctx.modelRegistry.find("proxy", "cc/claude-opus-4-7")` and pass the result to `pi.setModel(refreshed)`
- **AND** pi's `agent.state.model.reasoning` SHALL become `true` after this call
- **AND** subsequent calls to `pi.setThinkingLevel("high")` SHALL no longer clamp to `"off"`

#### Scenario: Re-setModel failure does not abort session_start

- **WHEN** `pi.setModel(refreshed)` throws (e.g., auth missing for the refreshed model)
- **THEN** the `session_start` handler SHALL catch the error, log it via `console.error`, and continue with the rest of its work (setting `currentSessionProvider` / `currentSessionModelId`, emitting warnings for missing API keys)
- **AND** the session SHALL still be usable — just with the pre-enrichment model snapshot still in place

#### Scenario: Enrichment falls back when registry capture has not happened

- **WHEN** no `session_start` event has fired (e.g., the extension was just activated and pi has not yet started a session)
- **AND** a provider advertises `cc/claude-opus-4-7` under `api: "anthropic-messages"`
- **THEN** `registerEntry()` SHALL still call `pi.registerProvider(...)` successfully
- **AND** the synthesized model descriptor SHALL use the `anthropic-messages` fallback defaults (200k ctx, 64k maxTok, no reasoning, zero cost, `["text","image"]` input)

#### Scenario: Enrichment applied on credentials_updated hot-reload

- **WHEN** a user adds a new provider to `providers.json` whose `/v1/models` response includes `claude-opus-4-7`
- **AND** the server broadcasts `credentials_updated`
- **AND** the bridge's `reloadProviders` flow calls `registerEntry()` for the new provider
- **AND** the registry is available at this point
- **THEN** the synthesized model SHALL have `contextWindow: 1_000_000` (not `200_000`)

#### Scenario: Unknown model on a custom provider still registers successfully

- **WHEN** a proxy advertises a model id that the registry does not know
- **AND** `entry.api` is `"openai-completions"`
- **THEN** `registerEntry()` SHALL still call `pi.registerProvider(...)` with the fallback defaults `{ contextWindow: 128_000, maxTokens: 16_384, reasoning: false, cost: zero, input: ["text","image"] }`
- **AND** the model SHALL be selectable in the dashboard's model picker

#### Scenario: No registry match does not throw

- **WHEN** every discovered id from a provider misses the registry
- **THEN** `registerEntry()` SHALL complete successfully without throwing
- **AND** every model SHALL be registered with fallback defaults
