## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Placeholder card shown during session spawn
When the user (or programmatic flow) issues a spawn, the system SHALL immediately render a placeholder skeleton card at the top of the target group's session list. The placeholder SHALL display a pulse/loading animation. Placeholders SHALL be keyed by the spawn `requestId` (UUIDv4 minted by the client at dispatch time), NOT by the cwd. Multiple placeholders MAY render simultaneously in the same group when multiple spawns are in-flight for the same cwd.

The client SHALL maintain `pendingSpawns: Map<requestId, { cwd, startedAt, attachProposal? }>` (replacing today's `spawningCwds: Set<cwd>`). Each placeholder card's React key SHALL be the `requestId`.

#### Scenario: User clicks New in a group
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "New" button in a workspace group header
- **THEN** the client SHALL generate a fresh `requestId` and insert into `pendingSpawns`
- **AND** a placeholder card with pulse animation SHALL appear at the top of that group's session list immediately, before any server response

#### Scenario: Placeholder appears above existing sessions
- **WHEN** one or more placeholder cards are rendered for a group
- **THEN** all placeholders SHALL appear before all real session cards in that group

#### Scenario: Multiple placeholders coexist in same cwd
- **WHEN** two `spawn_session` dispatches occur in the same cwd within milliseconds (e.g. programmatic flow or fast double-click escaping the disabled-button guard)
- **THEN** TWO placeholder cards SHALL render in that group's list, each keyed by its distinct `requestId`
- **AND** each SHALL be dismissed independently when its matching `session_added` arrives

### Requirement: New button disabled during spawn
The "New" button in a workspace group header SHALL be disabled while at least one entry in `pendingSpawns` has `cwd` equal to that group's cwd. Other groups' "New" buttons SHALL remain enabled.

#### Scenario: New button disabled for spawning group
- **WHEN** at least one `pendingSpawns` entry has `cwd` matching the group's cwd
- **THEN** that group's "New" button SHALL be disabled (not clickable)
- **AND** "New" buttons for other groups SHALL remain enabled

#### Scenario: New button re-enabled when last placeholder clears
- **WHEN** every `pendingSpawns` entry for that cwd has been removed
- **THEN** the group's "New" button SHALL be re-enabled

### Requirement: Placeholder replaced on session added matching requestId
When a `session_added` message arrives carrying `spawnRequestId` matching an entry in `pendingSpawns`, the system SHALL: (a) remove that entry from `pendingSpawns`, (b) cancel any associated timeout timer, (c) navigate to the new session's URL. The real session card SHALL render in its place via the normal session rendering pipeline.

#### Scenario: session_added with matching spawnRequestId replaces placeholder
- **WHEN** a `session_added { session, spawnRequestId: "rq_42" }` message arrives
- **AND** `pendingSpawns` contains an entry with key `rq_42`
- **THEN** the placeholder for `rq_42` SHALL be removed
- **AND** the client SHALL navigate to `/session/<session.id>`
- **AND** the real session card SHALL render in the group's list

#### Scenario: session_added without spawnRequestId is treated as natural arrival
- **WHEN** `session_added { session }` arrives without a `spawnRequestId` (e.g. TUI-spawned session)
- **THEN** no placeholder SHALL be removed (none was matched)
- **AND** no auto-navigation SHALL occur
- **AND** the new session SHALL still render in its group via the normal pipeline

#### Scenario: session_added with unknown spawnRequestId
- **WHEN** `session_added { session, spawnRequestId: "rq_unknown" }` arrives but `pendingSpawns` has no matching entry (e.g. timeout already cleared)
- **THEN** the client SHALL render the session normally without crashing or navigating

### Requirement: Placeholder removed on spawn failure matching requestId
When a `spawn_result` message arrives with `success: false`, the system SHALL look up the `requestId` (when echoed) in `pendingSpawns` and remove that specific placeholder. When `requestId` is absent (legacy server), the system SHALL fall back to the previous cwd-based behavior: remove the FIRST placeholder for that cwd. An error toast SHALL be displayed. A `spawn_error` message arriving for the same cwd SHALL provide rich detail (code, stderr, reasons).

#### Scenario: spawn_result failure with requestId removes specific placeholder
- **WHEN** `spawn_result { cwd, success: false, requestId: "rq_42", message }` arrives
- **THEN** the placeholder keyed by `rq_42` SHALL be removed
- **AND** an error toast SHALL be displayed
- **AND** other placeholders in the same cwd SHALL remain unaffected

#### Scenario: spawn_result failure without requestId falls back to cwd
- **WHEN** `spawn_result { cwd, success: false, message }` arrives without `requestId` (legacy server)
- **AND** at least one placeholder exists for that cwd
- **THEN** ONE placeholder for that cwd SHALL be removed (oldest by `startedAt`)
- **AND** an error toast SHALL be displayed

### Requirement: Safety timeout for stuck placeholders
Each entry in `pendingSpawns` SHALL have an associated timer (default 30 seconds, aligned with `spawn-register-watchdog` config). If neither `session_added` matching `requestId` nor a failed `spawn_result` clears the entry within the timeout, the system SHALL automatically remove the entry. The timer SHALL be per-`requestId` (not per-cwd).

#### Scenario: Timeout clears specific placeholder
- **WHEN** 30 seconds elapse after `pendingSpawns` entry `rq_x` was created
- **AND** the entry has not been cleared
- **THEN** that placeholder SHALL be automatically removed
- **AND** the "New" button SHALL be re-enabled if no other entries remain for that cwd
